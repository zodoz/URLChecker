What this does
==============

This is a basic URL tester that has certainly been done before.  Currently, the code **will** have to be modified to work with another site, but this should work rather well otherwise.

Why I did this
==============

I was able to find other URL checkers out there, but what I needed that I could not find was a checker which would allow me to filter the broken link results to only those which come from certain directories.  So that is what I did.  This code learns every link on a website and know where the links came from and where that page links to (assuming the link is internal to the site).

Right now, this is more of a personal project to quickly solve a problem I am having.  If others are interested, I would be happy to work on this code and put a GUI on it as well as make it easier to use.  Just let me know.
